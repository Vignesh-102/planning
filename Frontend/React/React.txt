REACT

    Topic 1: Routing 
        import {
          Routes,
          Route,
          useNavigate
        } from "react-router-dom";

      react router will first match the specific route and then then dynamic ones.
      Index Routes
      Lazy loading Routes
      params
      search params - query strings
      gaurded Routes

    Topic 2: replace: true  in useNavigate()
       It's a redirect, replacing the current entry in the history stack versus 
       PUSHing a new entry onto the top like a regular navigation.

       eg. after login page, we will replace so that on click of back button 
       will not go to loginpage after logged in
       
    Topic 3: Hooks
      React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to 
      isolate the reusable part from a functional component.
      
    Topi 4: state
      Unlike normal variables, state variables trigger a re-render of the component whenever 
      their value changes. This dynamic behavior enables React components to return 
      active data updates and provide an ideal user experience
